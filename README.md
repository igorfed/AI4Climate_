# AI4Climate project

The repository contains Torch implementation to detect flooded water on the image based on well known EfficientNet and DenseNet architecture achieving at the selected pictures.

## Notes

For a moment it contains only two classes: Class 0 - No water, Class 1 - has water. Soon, it will update for water categories. </br> Repository contains scripts to read the annotation, provide common structure of existed images and split it into the datasets to train and validate results. It also contain configuration file, and models implemented from scratch.
